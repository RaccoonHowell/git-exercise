## git clone
git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. In this page we'll discuss extended configuration options and common use cases of git clone . Some points we'll cover here are: Cloning a local or remote repository.

### git branch
The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.

## git checkout
The "checkout" command can switch the currently active branch - but it can also be used to restore files.

The most common use case for "checkout" is when you want to switch to a different branch, making it the new HEAD branch.

Another use case for "checkout" is when you want to restore a historic version of a specific file. Thereby, you can reset single files to earlier revisions - while keeping the rest of the project untouched.
